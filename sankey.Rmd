# Introduction  

> Sankey Diagrams are directed, weighted graphs.  

> Sankey Diagrams are particularly appropriate for representing flow through a system in that it gives an immediate visualisation of the weight of the flows and thus enables priority areas to be identified and tackled.

The purpose of these notes is to explore how to use Sankey diagrams via R. In particular, for the Early Intervention & Prevention programme (EIP).  

We have had some initial success producing Sankey diagrams for Pass 1 of the Children's Early Help (CEH) project, which is part of the EIP programme. To build on this success we need to better understand:  

1. Network analysis, of which Sankeys are a part.  
1. JavaScript, and in particular the D3 library, for dynamic, interactive data visualisations in web browsers.  

## Resources  

The reading and examples around this subject were frustratingly piecemeal until we came across the new [Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics](https://ona-book.org/) (2022, Keith McNulty). The Foreword,  Introduction and Chapter 1 provide motivation and outline practical applications of graphs and networks. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 11 are more technical and provide the basis for what we need for the CEH project. 

The example followed in the CEH project for Pass 1 (before we found the handbook) was [Most basic Sankey Diagram – the R Graph Gallery (r-graph-gallery.com)](https://r-graph-gallery.com/321-introduction-to-interactive-sankey-diagram-2.html). The [R Gallery Book](https://bookdown.org/content/b298e479-b1ab-49fa-b83d-a57c2b034d49/flow.html#sankey-diagram) would have been better to work from.

## Network analysis  

*Vertices* and *edges* seem to be the key terms used in network analysis books. Probably not as intuitive as the terms *nodes* and *links* used in some R packages. *Points* and *lines* would probably not differentiate it enough from a regular x and y axis graph. *Junctions* and *roads* too metaphorical? The *amount of traffic*, *weight*, *size of flow*, *value*, *edge attribute*, all relate to how much is passing from one vertex to another.  

In addition to other types of network visualisation, such as chord or weighted arc diagrams, network analysis is useful where connections rather than transactions are the priority.    

> Graph databases store data so that finding relationships is the primary priority. This contrasts with traditional databases where finding transactions is the primary priority.


## networkD3 package

These notes are going to focus on using the `networkD3` R package: 
[christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/).

Other Sankey and Alluvial specific packages were considered. However, `networkD3` seemed the best bet in terms of package maintenance and examples. Plus, familiarity with the package could help us produce other types of network diagrams. Consideration of other packages was not especially thorough.

> The networkD3 package offers useful, convenient ways for non-Javascript programmers to make use of many of the great capabilities of the D3 visualisation library. However, the package’s customization potential is limited. For those who can program in D3, the scope exists to create amazing interactive graph visualisations, with limitless customization potential.

We don't need the Sankey to be dynamic and interactive for CEH. Certainly not initially for the high level group visualisations. However, Sankey's quickly become unwieldy with too much information, which is where the interaction, the ability for the reader to explore the diagram, is useful. Additionaly, the D3 options for Sankey are simpler to use than to build a static alternative. In short, some JavaScript looks unavoidable. Reassuringly, Hadley Wickham tweeted recently that he expected JavaScript to be tied to the future of R visualisations, so it's a good skill to invest in.

James Ford has asked about the possibility of a *Sankey Pivot* - a Sankey where different aspects can be selected. Maybe something like this, [observablehq.com/@d3/sankey](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey), but with, for example, being able to select of types of Early Help, rather than link colour. Including the Sankey in a [flexdashboard](https://scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/rmd.html#flexdashboard) might be the easiest way to accomplish this and avoid too much JavaScript.

# Handbook example

Sankey example from the Handbook in [3.1.5 Interactive graph visualization using 'networkD3'](https://ona-book.org/viz-graphs.html#interactive-graph-visualization-using-networkd3).

```{r handbook-eg}
# get data
eu_referendum <- read.csv(
  "https://ona-book.org/data/eu_referendum.csv"
)

# aggregate by region
results <- eu_referendum |>  
  dplyr::group_by(Region) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(Remain = sum(Remain), Leave = sum(Leave)) |> 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-Region, names_to = "result", 
                      values_to = "votes")

# create unique regions, "Leave" and "Remain" for nodes dataframe
regions <- unique(results$Region)
nodes <- data.frame(node = c(0:13), 
                    name = c(regions, "Leave", "Remain"))

# create edges/links dataframe
results <- results |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(nodes, by = c("Region" = "name")) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(nodes, by = c("result" = "name"))

links <- results[ , c("node.x", "node.y", "votes")]
colnames(links) <- c("source", "target", "value")

# visualize using sankeyNetwork
networkD3::sankeyNetwork(
  Links = links, Nodes = nodes, Source = 'source', Target = 'target', 
  Value = 'value', NodeID = 'name', units = 'votes', fontSize = 12
)
```


# Sankey example  

We've had some reasonable success with initial Sankey outputs in the CEH project. As ever though, there's room to improve how legible and reusable our code is. We're also starting to look into a level of control that requires JavaScript.  

We're going to look at a couple of things initially: 

1. A good outline of the Sankey process using the `networkD3` package - 
[RPubs - Introduction to Creating Sankey diagrams for Educational Research In R](https://rpubs.com/droach/CPP526-codethrough).  
1. Using the [`igraph` R package](https://igraph.org/r/) as suggested by the [`networkD3` documentation](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/#igraph).

## Sample data 

```{r ceh-simple-png}
#| echo=FALSE,
#| out.width="60%",
#| out.extra = 'style="float:right; padding:10px"' 
knitr::include_graphics("resources/EH-Map-v.simple.png")
```

We'll use the groupings we have of children that receive either Social Care interventions (group 1), Early Help engagements (group 3), or both (group 2).

<div class="row"/>  

> Create a data frame of nodes

```{r nodes-df, class.source="fold-hide", fig.align='left'}
# Nodes of our groups with some sample data
ceh_groups <- tribble(
    ~GROUP,      ~CHILDREN,     
    "1 SC",     4000,
    "2 EH SC",  4000,
    "3 EH",     22000
  )

# Starting node i.e. our cohort of children
ceh_children <- ceh_groups %>% 
  count(wt = CHILDREN, name = "CHILDREN", GROUP = "Children")

# Early Help node
ceh_early_help <- ceh_groups %>% 
  filter(GROUP != "1 SC") %>% 
  count(wt = CHILDREN, name = "CHILDREN", GROUP = "Early Help")

# Combine the nodes in a single data frame
ceh_nodes <- bind_rows(ceh_children, ceh_early_help, ceh_groups)

# Tidy as we go
rm(ceh_groups, ceh_children, ceh_early_help)

# Display nodes table
ceh_nodes %>% 
  display_tbl() %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = CHILDREN, decimals = 0, use_seps = TRUE)
```

<br/>  

> Create a data frame of connections 

```{r connections-df, class.source="fold-hide"}
# Connections data frame
ceh_connections <- tribble(
    ~from,        ~to,     
    "Children",   "1 SC",
    "Children",   "Early Help",
    "Early Help", "2 EH SC",
    "Early Help", "3 EH"
  ) %>% 
  left_join(ceh_nodes, by = c("to" = "GROUP")) #add edge attribute

# Display connections table
ceh_connections %>% 
  display_tbl() %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = CHILDREN, decimals = 0, use_seps = TRUE)
```

## igraph  

Using `igraph` might be akin to the use of data standards and APIs i.e. a useful agreed common format, for network analysis. Initially it's use appears an unnecessary complication, but down the line its value may become more apparent.  

```{r igraph-example}
# Create the igraph object by passing it a data frame containing a symbolic edge
# list in the first 2 columns e.g. from & to.
# Additional columns are considered as edge attributes.
ceh_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(
  ceh_connections, 
  vertices = ceh_nodes, #data frame with vertex metadata
  directed = TRUE
)

# Convert to object suitable for networkD3
# One data frame of 'links' and another of 'nodes' returned in a list
ceh_d3 <- igraph_to_networkD3(ceh_graph, what = "both")

# Display links table
ceh_d3$links %>% 
  display_tbl %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = value, decimals = 0, use_seps = TRUE)

# Display nodes table
ceh_d3$nodes %>% 
  display_tbl()

# Display D3 Sankey diagram
sankeyNetwork(
  Links = ceh_d3$links, 
  Nodes = ceh_d3$nodes,
  Source = "source", 
  Target = "target", 
  Value = "value",
  NodeID = "name",
  nodeWidth = 40,
  fontSize = 13,
  nodePadding = 20,
  units = "children"
)
```

# Colours  

[Colour specific node in igraph](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31992685/colour-specific-node-in-igraph)

# Node attributes  

Need to use groups, memberships, communities etc.

```{r node-attributes}
ceh_d3$nodes$vertex.color <- "blue"
#V(mp_graph)$colour

# ceh_nodes <- mutate(ceh_nodes, clr = "red")
# 
# ceh_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(
#   ceh_connections, 
#   vertices = ceh_nodes, #data frame with vertex metadata
#   directed = TRUE
# )
# 
# ceh_graph <- set_vertex_attr(ceh_graph, name = "clr", value = "blue")


# Convert to object suitable for networkD3
# One data frame of 'links' and another of 'nodes' returned in a list
ceh_d3 <- igraph_to_networkD3(ceh_graph, what = "both")

# # Display links table
# ceh_d3$links %>% 
#   display_tbl %>% 
#   fmt_number(columns = value, decimals = 0, use_seps = TRUE)

# Display nodes table
ceh_d3$nodes %>% 
  display_tbl()

# Display D3 Sankey diagram
sankeyNetwork(
  Links = ceh_d3$links, 
  Nodes = ceh_d3$nodes,
  Source = "source", 
  Target = "target", 
  Value = "value",
  NodeID = "name",
  nodeWidth = 40,
  fontSize = 13,
  nodePadding = 20
)
